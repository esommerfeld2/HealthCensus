Our package will be built around data from Harvard Forest that measures the health of trees above 10 cm in diameter across a period of 4 years (2021-2024). From this data, we will create statistical and mathematical functions that can assess the diversity and health of the trees within the sample, with the goal of being able to generalize and apply these assessments to other forests and/or samples of trees. Our package functions will ideally be able to work in concert to produce an overall evaluation of the health of a given tree, as well as the health of the entire population of trees in the dataset. Our assessments might be useful for ecologists performing health surveys on a particular tree or population of trees.
The goal of our package is to provide functions and real data to allow for users to assess individual and population-wide tree health. This package could hypothetically be used to track health status of individual trees over the course of time. It could also be used to assess biodiversity across trees of different species to understand how different tree species have different ecological advantages over others. Another analysis could look at averages across the entire dataset over the years to understand how tree health changes over time, and to take a deeper look at an arboreal lifespan. Some potential tasks could include health assessments and biodiversity metrics, which is particularly useful since the package utilizes real-world data over a span of recent years as a basis for our functions (data in R package).
