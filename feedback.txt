Ella, Rose, and Catherine, excellent job on the package so far! You all have made considerable progress on the project, with the basic framework in place. You did have 2 notes come up on my end -- associated with minor things (just make sure to fix those details, which I've described below.)

For the second checkpoint, definitely try to get the basic functionality of the whole process to work so you're able to run a logistic regression (for example). I think your focus will shift to more technical and methodological procedures, which will rely a lot on functions from potential packages. Nonetheless, you're mostly past the package setup, and that's a good positive.

These are some of the notes I got from my check, which just stemmed from using Data instead of data, as well as one undefined function/variable.

❯ checking top-level files ... NOTE
  Non-standard file/directory found at top level:
    'Data'

❯ checking R code for possible problems ... [12s] NOTE
  summary_health: no visible binding for global variable 'status'
  Undefined global functions or variables:
    status

Some other suggestions/things to keep in mind going into the second checkpoint:

- I think it may be beneficial to merge the four data__.Rd files into one if possible, especially because of the redundancy of information.
- There seems to be a bunch of NAs in the final data frame when using the summary health function. Definitely try to determine a way to proceed with the NAs -- either add a note about the NAs or strip them entirely when printing the data out.
- For the logistic regression function, you may be better off having an input that contains all possible predictors in a single data frame and another input with the response.
