  Our package will be built around data from Harvard Forest that measures the health of trees above 10 cm in diameter across a period of 4 years (2021-2024). From this data, we will create statistical and mathematical functions that can assess the diversity and health of the trees within the sample, with the goal of being able to generalize and apply these assessments to other forests and/or samples of trees. Our package functions will ideally be able to work in concert to produce an overall evaluation of the health of a given tree, as well as the health of the entire population of trees in the dataset. The assessments generated by the package functionality could be useful for ecologists performing health surveys on a particular tree or population of trees. 

  The goal of this package is to provide mathematical functions and real data to allow for users to assess individual and population-wide tree health. This package could hypothetically be used to track health status of individual trees over the course of time. It could also be used to assess biodiversity across trees of different species to understand how different tree species have different ecological advantages over others. Another analysis could look at averages across the entire dataset over the years to understand how tree health changes over time, and to take a deeper look at an arboreal lifespan. Some potential tasks could include health assessments and biodiversity metrics, which is particularly useful since the package utilizes real-world data over a span of recent years as a basis for our functions (data in R package).

  Here is a brief overview of our package functions and their primary usages: 
1. field_means(): Takes the mean of a numeric variable, such as 'percentage_of_crown_living' or 'dbh', grouped by a categorical variable such as 'species', 'status', or 'crown_position'.
2. comb_frame(): Combines the data frames from the four different years into one large dataset, cleans this new dataset, and creates a new column with the variable name 'year' which groups the data by year. 
3. sum_trees(): Calculates the total number of trees for each *level* of a given categorical variable. 
4. summary_health_year(): Prints summary statistics for indices of tree health (e.g. 'percentage_of_crown_intact', 'percentage_of_crown_living') either across all four years, or for one specific year. Creates a data set for these summary statistics. 
5. summary_health_species(): Enables species-specific analysis by tracking health indices across all 4 years and creating summary statistics grouped by user input of a specific species. 
6. ind_tree_id(): Tracks health indices of one individual tree over the course of the 4 years based on user input of the specific tree ID ('stem_tag'). 
7. logistic_reg_health(): Conducts logistic regression based on 'status' variable which indicates whether tree is alive or dead. Can use various variables from the dataset based on user input to determine main factors for survival. 
8. future_tree(): Predicts tree survival in future years based on probabilities of survival/measurements of tree health in previous years.
9. graph_trees(): Generates visualizations (graphs, barplots, scatterplots, etc) that plot indices of tree health. 
10. biodiv_trees(): Tracks indices of tree health as a function of the quadrat a given tree is in to measure the impact of tree biodiversity on mortality.
